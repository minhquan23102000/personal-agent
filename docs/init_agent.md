# Agent Initialization Feature

## Description
When initializing a new agent, offer users the option to create a personalized profile. This process involves asking tailored questions to infer user preferences, communication styles, and personality traits, enabling the agent to adapt and provide more personalized interactions.

## Benefits
- Enhanced understanding of user needs and preferences
- More engaging and personalized agent interactions
- Improved accuracy and relevance of agent responses

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Trigger Condition:
   - Activate during the first user interaction with a new agent
   - Check for absence of memory context in the conversation

2. User Profiling Process:
   - Ask questions to infer:
     - Communication preferences
     - Personality traits (using psychology-based questions)
     - Other relevant aspects

3. System Prompt Creation:
   - Generate a system prompt based on user responses
   - Focus on instructional content rather than agent context

4. Memory and Context Initialization:
   a. Create a `context_memory` object:
      - Represent user preferences
      - Initialize agent information
   b. Generate a personalized system prompt

5. Agent Initialization:
   - Initialize the agent with:
     - The created `context_memory` object
     - The personalized system prompt

## Key Considerations
- Utilize LLM-based inference for flexibility in prompt generation
- Avoid hard-coding or rule-based logic for question selection
- Refer to `src/agent/base_agent.py` for implementation flow
- Refer to `src/memory/models.py` and `src/memory/memory_manager.py` for memory management

## Best Practices
- Prioritize authenticity in AI interactions
- Adapt language complexity to match user's style
- Balance technical content with engaging elements
