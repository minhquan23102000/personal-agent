# Feature Description
When first starting a new agent, the user should be given the option to create a new profile of the agent. By asking the user question to infer their preferences, the agent should be able to create a profile that best fits their needs.

Note: Do not ask too direct questions. Ask questions that are more thoughtful of personalized, and explicit about what the user is trying to achieve.
