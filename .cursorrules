# Code guidelines
* Use keyword arguments in function calls and include type hints for clarity. 
* Document your code thoroughly, specifying arguments, keyword arguments, return types, and descriptions to ensure maintainability. 
* Follow SOLID principles to enhance code organization. 
* Import modules using absolute paths from the `src` directory (e.g., `from src.memory.models import ShortTermMemory`). 
* Utilize the `loguru` package for logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring. 
* Implement complete code as per the requirements; avoid truncation (e.g., NEVER LEAVE placeholders like "# ... Implement other abstract methods...", "# ... Implement other methods...", "# ... Implement other functions...", "  # Additional delegated methods as needed..."). 
* Ensure your code is clean and readable for future reference.
